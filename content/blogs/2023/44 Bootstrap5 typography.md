When it comes to creating a website, making your text and headings look stylish is essential. Luckily, you don't need to be a design expert to achieve this. Bootstrap offers a set of easy-to-use typography classes that can help you style your text and headings effortlessly.

## What are Typography Classes?

Typography classes in Bootstrap are predefined styles and formatting options that you can apply to your text and headings. These classes are like ready-made outfits for your content, and all you need to do is pick the ones that suit your website's style.

## How to Style Text with Bootstrap Typography Classes

1. **Font Weight:**
   You can make your text bold or extra bold by using the `.font-weight-bold` class. Here's an example:
   ```html
   <p class="font-weight-bold">This text is bold.</p>
   ```
2. **Text Alignment:**
   You can align your text to the left, right, center, or justify it using classes like `.text-left`, `.text-right`, `.text-center`, and `.text-justify`.
3. **Text Color:**
   You can change the color of your text by applying classes like `.text-primary`, `.text-danger`, or `.text-success`.

## How to Style Headings with Bootstrap Typography Classes

1. **Heading Size:**
   Bootstrap provides classes for headings from `<h1>` to `<h6`. You can adjust the size of your headings by using classes like `.h1`, `.h2`, and so on.
   ```html
   <h1 class="h2">This is a smaller heading.</h1>
   ```
2. **Heading Color:**
   You can change the color of your headings in a similar way to text color, using classes like `.text-primary`, `.text-danger`, or `.text-success`.
