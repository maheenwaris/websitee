As a web developer, I like trying out new tools that can make my work easier. Recently, I decided to explore **Deno**, a modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript. Here’s how it went.

## First Impressions
Right away, I noticed how simple Deno is to use. It has **built-in TypeScript support**, so I didn’t have to mess with complicated setups. I could write clear, type-safe code right from the start, which felt great.

## Security Features
One of the things I really liked was Deno’s **security**. It requires permissions for file access and network requests, making my code safer. This focus on security helped me feel more confident while building applications.

## Simplified Development
Deno’s **minimalist design** was a breath of fresh air. I spent less time dealing with configuration and more time coding. Plus, Deno has **built-in tools** for testing and formatting, which made my workflow smoother.

## Challenges I Faced
Of course, not everything was perfect. I found that the **ecosystem isn’t as big** as Node.js, so sometimes I had to search a bit harder for libraries or resources. But the Deno community is growing, and I managed to find what I needed or come up with my own solutions.

## Final Thoughts
Overall, my experience with Deno has been positive. It’s a great choice for anyone looking for a simpler way to build applications. If you haven’t tried Deno yet, I encourage you to give it a shot. You might find that programming can be straightforward and enjoyable!
