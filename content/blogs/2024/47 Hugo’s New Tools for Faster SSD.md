As a frontend developer, I’ve been using Hugo to build fast, secure websites. Hugo generates static HTML files, which means no databases or server-side code—just pure speed and simplicity. Recently, Hugo introduced new build tools that have made the process even quicker and more efficient.

### Why I Use Hugo

Hugo stands out for its **speed**. It rebuilds your site almost instantly, which is a huge benefit when working with larger projects. Plus, static sites are more secure and easier to maintain compared to traditional sites.

### What’s New in Hugo’s Build Tools?

1. **Improved Asset Pipeline**  
   Hugo’s new tools automate asset optimization, so images, stylesheets, and JavaScript load faster with minimal effort.
2. **Faster Incremental Builds**  
   Now, Hugo only rebuilds the parts of the site that change, speeding up the development process even more.
3. **Better Module System**  
   Hugo’s updated module system simplifies managing themes, libraries, and reusable components across projects.

### How These Tools Helped Me

These new tools have made my development process smoother. Faster builds, optimized assets, and simpler dependency management mean I can focus more on creating content and less on troubleshooting.
